            Center, or a Slack channel. Mention your teammate in a discussion to involve them, and subscribe to tasks
            to get up-to-the-minute issue and article updates. KenTrack allows you to customize the workflows to fit
            your specific processes; for instance, it is possible to set events in your projects that when triggered
            will notify specific people.
